And these gameplay windows are *uniquely* defined by the (gameId, dividerId) doublet\n  - In order to find \"similarity scores\" you must have a \"seed play\", i.e. \"I want the top 100 plays (unique (gameId, dividerId)) that are most like *this* play (seed play: (gameId, dividerId))\"\n  - Event Chain logic is a separate model that will apply downstream of this ranking pipeline, and combine the results of itself with the rankings of this heatmaps pipline\n\n  \n### Logical Steps\n\nThe process/pipeline from df_preprocessed to similarity score ranked list, can be thought of as *five* logical steps across *two* notebooks.  These steps are:\n  1) pull in the tracking data with (preprocessed) features assigned to dividerIds, which is the output of real_time_preprocessing, we call it \"df_preprocessed\"\n  2) organize the tracking data into counts of position (and whatever other heatmaps created in the future) into a table per type of heatmap. (e.g. one table for position heatmaps, one table for velocity heatmaps...)\n  3) pull in all above tables, aggegate the cours, and put each heatmap court as a column in one dataframe, and split by test and train dataframes, and write out test and train dataframes\n  4) Train the VAE and organize results, plot visuals\n  5) Write out the results of searched given a set of seed plays\n  \n  \n### Notebooks\n\nThe logical steps above are to be found within two notbooks.\n  - A) Generate Heatmaps: has logical steps 1) and 2) from the above list.
